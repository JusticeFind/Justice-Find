    <h3>Human Trafficking</h3>
    <!--This is where the summaries go -->
    <p>While you may think that slavery is illegal, modern slavery, known as human trafficking, still occurs all over the world. Sadly, not even the United States is a haven from these events as new cases are being discovered every day. So, what does modern human trafficking look like? Well, there are two main forms of this, sex trafficking and forced labor (some being state imposed). A lot of the time, victims of these events are told that they are going to work for a family, and they arrive there only to be deprived of their rights and personal belongings. </p>
    <p>Human trafficking happens all over the world. A report from September 17 estimates that there are 24.9 million victims around the world. From that an estimated 64% were forced into labor, 19% were sextually assaulted, and 17% were forced into labor by the state. The fact that this even exists is absolutely disgusting. From all this free labor, human traffickers make an estimated $150 billion a year. While national agencies are working all around the world to stop this issue, being able to tell if someone is being trafficked is something you should know.</p>
    <p>Some signs of human trafficking at worksites include,working extremely long hours, not being allowed to take breaks and if the worksite has high security measures including opaque windows, barbed wires, and security cameras. Some abnormal behaviors displayed by victims include, fearful, anxious, or tense demeanor, having no eye contact, appearing starved, a loss of a sense of time, and having no idea about their location. Some questions you can ask include: </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; text-transform: initial;">
      <li>“Are you able to leave your job if you want to?”, </li>
      <li>“If you tried to leave, would you be hurt?”,</li>
      <li> “Do you live with your boss?”, and </li>
      <li>“Do you owe a debt to your boss?”</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you recognize a human trafficking victim, provide the person with the human trafficking helpline 888-373-7888, or call 911.</p>
